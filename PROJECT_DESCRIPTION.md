# ChainWaterSave - Project Description

ChainWaterSave is a privacy-preserving decentralized application that enables users to record and track daily water-saving actions on the blockchain. Built on FHEVM (Fully Homomorphic Encryption Virtual Machine), the platform encrypts sensitive data while allowing secure aggregation and statistical analysis.

Users can submit various water-saving actions including shorter showers, closing faucets, rainwater collection, and water reuse. The system tracks consecutive participation days, personal trends, and group contributions. An NFT badge system rewards users for achieving milestones at 7, 30, and 100 consecutive days.

The application combines Solidity smart contracts with a Next.js frontend, leveraging FHEVM v0.9 to perform computations on encrypted data without decryption, setting a new standard for privacy-preserving environmental tracking.
